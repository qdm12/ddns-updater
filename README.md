![Web UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/master/readme/webui.png)

- 11MB Docker image based on a Go static binary in a Scratch Docker image
- Persistence with a JSON file *updates.json* to store old IP addresses with change times for each record
- Docker healthcheck verifying the DNS resolution of your domains
- Highly configurable
- Send notifications with [**Shoutrrr**](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/services/overview/) using `SHOUTRRR_ADDRESSES`
- Compatible with `amd64`, `386`, `arm64`, `armv7`, `armv6`, `s390x`, `ppc64le`, `riscv64` CPU architectures.

## Setup

The program reads the configuration from a JSON object, either from a file or from an environment variable.

1. Create a directory of your choice, say *data* with a file named **config.json** inside:

    ```sh
    mkdir data
    touch data/config.json
    # Owned by user ID of Docker container (1000)
    chown -R 1000 data
    # all access (for creating json database file data/updates.json)
    chmod 700 data
    # read access only
    chmod 400 data/config.json
    ```

    If you want to use another user ID, [build the image yourself](#build-the-image) with `--build-arg UID=<your-uid>`. You could also just run the container as root with `--user="0"` but this is not advised security wise.
1. Write a JSON configuration in *data/config.json*, for example:

    ```json
    {
        "settings": [
            {
                "provider": "namecheap",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "host": "@",
                "password": "e5322165c1d74692bfa6d807100c0310"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    You can find more information in the [configuration section](#configuration) to customize it.

1. Run the container with

    ```sh
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000/tcp -v "$(pwd)"/data:/updater/data qmcgaw/ddns-updater
    ```

1. ⚠️ If you use IPv6, you might need to set `-e IPV6_PREFIX=/64` (`/64` is your prefix, depending on your ISP)
1. (Optional) You can also set your JSON configuration as a single environment variable line (i.e. `{"settings": [{"provider": "namecheap", ...}]}`), which takes precedence over config.json. Note however that if you don't bind mount the `/updater/data` directory, there won't be a persistent database file `/updater/updates.json` but it will still work.

### Next steps

You can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/ddns-updater`. Other [Docker image tags are available](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qmcgaw/ddns-updater/tags).

### GHCR

Images are also added to the Github Container Registry. To use the GHCR container replace `qmcgaw/ddns-updater` to `ghcr.io/qdm12/ddns-updater`, further details are available [here](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/pkgs/container/ddns-updater)

## Configuration

Start by having the following content in *config.json*, or in your `CONFIG` environment variable:

```json
{
    "settings": [
        {
            "provider": "",
        },
        {
            "provider": "",
        }
    ]
}
```

For each setting, you need to fill in parameters.

#### Public IP

By default, all public IP fetching types are used and cycled (over DNS and over HTTPs).

On top of that, for each fetching method, all echo services available are cycled on each request.

This allows you not to be blocked for making too many requests.

You can otherwise customize it with the following:

- `PUBLICIP_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 or IPv6 address. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ifconfig` using [https://ifconfig.io/ip](https://ifconfig.io/ip)
  - `ipinfo` using [https://ipinfo.io/ip](https://ipinfo.io/ip)
  - `google` using [https://domains.google.com/checkip](https://domains.google.com/checkip)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL such as `https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIPV4_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 address only. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ipify` using [https://api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org)
  - `noip` using [http://ip1.dynupdate.no-ip.com](http://ip1.dynupdate.no-ip.com)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL such as `https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIPV6_HTTP_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv6 address only. It can be one or more of the following:
  - `ipify` using [https://api6.ipify.org](https://api6.ipify.org)
  - `noip` using [http://ip1.dynupdate6.no-ip.com](http://ip1.dynupdate6.no-ip.com)
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL such as `https://ipinfo.io/ip`
- `PUBLICIP_DNS_PROVIDERS` gets your public IPv4 address only or IPv6 address only or one of them (see #136). It can be one or more of the following:
  - `google`
  - `cloudflare`
  - `opendns`

### Host firewall

If you have a host firewall in place, this container needs the following ports:

- TCP 443 outbound for outbound HTTPS
- UDP 53 outbound for outbound DNS resolution
- TCP 8000 inbound (or other) for the WebUI

## Architecture

At program start and every period (5 minutes by default):

1. Fetch your public IP address
1. For each record:
    1. DNS resolve it to obtain its current IP address(es)
        - If the resolution fails, update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API and finish
    1. Check if your public IP address is within the resolved IP addresses
        - Yes: skip the update
        - No: update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API

💡 We do DNS resolution every period so it detects a change made to the record manually, for example on the DNS provider web UI
💡 As DNS resolutions are essentially free and without rate limiting, these are great to avoid getting banned for too many requests.

### Special case: Cloudflare

For Cloudflare records with the `proxied` option, the following is done.

At program start and every period (5 minutes by default), for each record:

1. Fetch your public IP address
1. For each record:
    1. Check the last IP address (persisted in `updates.json`) for that record
        - If it doesn't exist, update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API and finish
    1. Check if your public IP address matches the last IP address you updated the record with
        - Yes: skip the update
        - No: update the record with your public IP address by calling the DNS provider API

This is the only way as doing a DNS resolution on the record will give the IP address of a Cloudflare server instead of your server.

⚠️ This has the disadvantage that if the record is changed manually, the program will not detect it.
We could do an API call to get the record IP address every period, but that would get you banned especially with a low period duration.

## Testing

- The automated healthcheck verifies all your records are up to date [using DNS lookups](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/internal/healthcheck/healthcheck.go#L15)
- You can also manually check, by:
    1. Going to your DNS management webpage
    1. Setting your record to `127.0.0.1`
    1. Run the container
    1. Refresh the DNS management webpage and verify the update happened

## Build the image

You can build the image yourself with:

```sh
docker build -t qmcgaw/ddns-updater https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater.git
```

You can use optional build arguments with `--build-arg KEY=VALUE` from the table below:

| Build argument | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UID` | `1000` | User ID running the container |
| `GID` | `1000` | User group ID running the container |
| `VERSION` | `unknown` | Version of the program and Docker image |
| `CREATED` | `an unknown date` | Build date of the program and Docker image |
| `COMMIT` | `unknown` | Commit hash of the program and Docker image |
