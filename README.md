## Features

- Updates periodically A records for different DNS providers: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, NoIP, Dreamhost, DuckDNS, DNSPod and Infomaniak (ask for more)
- Web User interface

![Web UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/master/readme/webui.png)

- 12.3MB Docker image based on a Go static binary in a Scratch Docker image with ca-certificates and timezone data
- Persistence with a JSON file *updates.json* to store old IP addresses with change times for each record
- Docker healthcheck verifying the DNS resolution of your domains
- Highly configurable
- Sends notifications to your Android phone, see the [**Gotify**](#Gotify) section (it's free, open source and self hosted 🆒)
- Compatible with `amd64`, `386`, `arm64`, `arm32v7` (Raspberry Pis) CPU architectures.

## Setup

1. To setup your domains initially, see the [Domain set up](#domain-set-up) section.
1. Create a directory of your choice, say *data* with a file named **config.json** inside:

    ```sh
    mkdir data
    touch data/config.json
    # Owned by user ID of Docker container (1000)
    chown -R 1000 data
    # all access (for creating json database file data/updates.json)
    chmod 700 data
    # read access only
    chmod 400 data/config.json
    ```

    *(You could change the user ID, for example with `1001`, by running the container with `--user=1001`)*

1. Modify the *data/config.json* file similarly to:

    ```json
    {
        "settings": [
            {
                "provider": "namecheap",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "host": "@",
                "ip_method": "provider",
                "delay": 86400,
                "password": "e5322165c1d74692bfa6d807100c0310"
            },
            {
                "provider": "duckdns",
                "domain": "example.duckdns.org",
                "ip_method": "provider",
                "token": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            },
            {
                "provider": "godaddy",
                "domain": "example.org",
                "host": "subdomain",
                "ip_method": "duckduckgo",
                "key": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
                "secret": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    See more information in the [configuration section](#configuration)

1. Use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000/tcp -v "$(pwd)"/data:/updater/data qmcgaw/ddns-updater
    ```

    You can also use [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) with:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1. You can update the image with `docker pull qmcgaw/ddns-updater`. Other [Docker image tags are available](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qmcgaw/ddns-updater/tags).

## Configuration

Start by having the following content in *config.json*:

```json
{
    "settings": [
        {
            "provider": "",
            "domain": "",
            "ip_method": "",
        },
        {
            "provider": "",
            "domain": "",
            "ip_method": "",
        }
    ]
}
```

The following parameters are to be added in *config.json*

For all record update configuration, you need the following:

- `"provider"` is the DNS provider and can be `"godaddy"`, `"namecheap"`, `"duckdns"`, `"dreamhost"`, `"cloudflare"`, `"noip"`, `"dnspod"` or `"ddnss"`
- `"domain"`
- `"ip_method"` is the method to obtain your public IP address and can be:
  - `"provider"` means the public IP is automatically determined by the DNS provider (**only for DuckDNs, Namecheap, Infomaniak and NoIP**), most reliable.
  - `"opendns"` using [https://diagnostic.opendns.com/myip](https://diagnostic.opendns.com/myip) (reliable)
  - `"ifconfig"` using [https://ifconfig.io/ip](https://ifconfig.io/ip) (may be rate limited)
  - `"ipinfo"` using [https://ipinfo.io/ip](https://ipinfo.io/ip) (may be rate limited)
  - `"ipify"` using [https://api.ipify.org](https://api.ipify.org) (may be rate limited)

  - `"ddnss"` using [https://ddnss.de/meineip.php](https://ddnss.de/meineip.php)
  - `"ddnss4"` using [https://ip4.ddnss.de/meineip.php](https://ip4.ddnss.de/meineip.php) for IPv4 only
  - `"ddnss6"` using [https://ip6.ddnss.de/meineip.php](https://ip6.ddnss.de/meineip.php) for IPv6 only
  - `"cycle"` to cycle between each external methods, in order to avoid being rate limited
  - You can also specify an HTTPS URL to obtain your public IP address (i.e. `"ip_method": "https://ipinfo.io/ip"`)

You can optionnally add the parameters:

- `"delay"` is the delay in seconds between each update. It defaults to the `DELAY` environment variable value.
- `"no_dns_lookup"` can be `true` or `false` and allows, if `true`, to prevent the periodic Docker healthcheck from running a DNS lookup on your domain.

For each DNS provider exist some specific parameters you need to add, as described below:

Special thanks to @Starttoaster for helping out with the [documentation](https://gist.github.com/Starttoaster/07d568c2a99ad7631dd776688c988326) and testing.

## Gotify

[![Gotify](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/readme/gotify.png?raw=true)](https://gotify.net)

[**Gotify**](https://gotify.net) is a simple server for sending and receiving messages, and it is **free**, **private** and **open source**

- It has an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.gotify) to receive notifications
- The app does not drain your battery 👍
- The notification server is self hosted, see [how to set it up with Docker](https://gotify.net/docs/install)
- The notifications only go through your own server (ideally through HTTPS though)

To set it up with DDNS updater:

1. Go to the Web GUI of Gotify
1. Login with the admin credentials
1. Create an app and copy the generated token to the environment variable `GOTIFYTOKEN` (for this container)
1. Set the `GOTIFYURL` variable to the URL of your Gotify server address (i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:8080` or `https://bla.com/gotify`)

## Testing

- The automated healthcheck verifies all your records are up to date [using DNS lookups](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/internal/healthcheck/healthcheck.go#L15)
- You can check manually at:
  - GoDaddy: [https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/yourdomain.com/dns](https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/yourdomain.com/dns) (replace yourdomain.com)

    [![GoDaddy DNS management](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/raw/master/readme/godaddydnsmanagement.png)](https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/)

    You might want to try to change the IP address to `127.0.0.1` to see if the update actually occurs.
