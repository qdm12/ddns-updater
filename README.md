## Features

- Updates periodically A records for different DNS providers: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, NoIP, Dreamhost, DuckDNS (ask for more)
- Web User interface

![Web UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/master/readme/webui.png)

- Lightweight based on Go and *Alpine 3.10* with Sqlite and Ca-Certificates packages
- Persistence with a sqlite database to store old IP addresses and previous update status
- Docker healthcheck verifying the DNS resolution of your domains
- Highly configurable

## Setup

1. To setup your domains initially, see the [Domain set up](#domain-set-up) section.
1. Create a directory of your choice, say *data* with a file named **config.json** inside:

    ```sh
    mkdir data
    touch data/config.json
    # Owned by user ID of Docker container (1000)
    chown -R 1000 data
    # all access (for sqlite database)
    chmod 700 data
    # read access only
    chmod 400 data/config.json
    ```

    *(You could change the user ID, for example with `1001`, by running the container with `--user=1001`)*

1. Modify the *data/config.json* file similarly to:

    ```json
    {
        "settings": [
            {
                "provider": "namecheap",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "host": "@",
                "ip_method": "provider",
                "delay": 86400,
                "password": "e5322165c1d74692bfa6d807100c0310"
            },
            {
                "provider": "duckdns",
                "domain": "example.duckdns.org",
                "ip_method": "provider",
                "token": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
            },
            {
                "provider": "godaddy",
                "domain": "example.org",
                "host": "subdomain",
                "ip_method": "duckduckgo",
                "key": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
                "secret": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
            },
            {
                "provider": "dreamhost",
                "domain": "example.info",
                "ip_method": "opendns",
                "key": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
            },
            {
                "provider": "dnspod",
                "domain": "example.com",
                "host": "@",
                "ip_method": "provider",
                "delay": 86400,
                "token": "id,token"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

## Domain set up

### Namecheap

[![Namecheap Website](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/raw/master/readme/namecheap.png)](https://www.namecheap.com)

1. Login to Namecheap at [https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx)

For **each domain name** you want to add, replace *example.com* in the following link with your domain name and go to [https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/**example.com**/advancedns](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/example.com/advancedns)

1. For each host you want to add (if you don't know, create one record with the host set to `*`):
    1. In the *HOST RECORDS* section, click on *ADD NEW RECORD*

        ![https://ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/mealracle.com/advancedns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/master/readme/namecheap1.png)

    1. Select the following settings and create the *A + Dynamic DNS Record*:

Special thanks to @Starttoaster for helping out with the [documentation](https://gist.github.com/Starttoaster/07d568c2a99ad7631dd776688c988326) and testing.

### NoIP

*Awaiting a contribution*

## Testing

- The automated healthcheck verifies all your records are up to date [using DNS lookups](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/blob/master/healthcheck/main.go)
- You can check manually at:
  - GoDaddy: https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/yourdomain.com/dns (replace yourdomain.com)

    [![GoDaddy DNS management](https://github.com/qdm12/ddns-updater/raw/master/readme/godaddydnsmanagement.png)](https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/)

    You might want to try to change the IP address to another one to see if the update actually occurs.
